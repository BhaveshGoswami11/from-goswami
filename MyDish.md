My favorite food is Chole Bhature. I love Chole Bhature because it’s a delicious and hearty dish. The combination of spicy chickpeas (chole) and the fluffy, fried bread (bhature) is incredibly satisfying. It’s a meal that’s full of flavor and perfect for any time of the day. Whether I’m enjoying it for breakfast or lunch, Chole Bhature always leaves me feeling happy and full.
